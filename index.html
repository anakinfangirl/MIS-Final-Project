        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2020, Clothes for our Planet began with a simple idea: to combine fashion with environmental responsibility. After seeing the growing impact of fast fashion on our planet, we knew we had to make a change. Our founders started creating clothing made from sustainable materials, and quickly grew into a brand with a mission to make eco-conscious fashion accessible to everyone.</p>

    <!-- Why We're Different Section -->
    <div class="section" id="why-different">
        <h2>Why We're Different</h2>
        <p>Unlike many clothing companies that rely on harmful production practices, we are committed to a completely sustainable supply chain. We use only organic cotton, recycled fabrics, and eco-friendly dyes. Our clothes are made to last, reducing waste, and we work with artisans who are paid fair wages. Our mission is not only to create beautiful clothing but to empower people to make a positive impact on the environment through their choices.</p>
